# Instrument a Python app with Prometheus and run it on Kubernetes

A lab to help you setup, explore, and test Prometheus metrics using a Python app running on Kubernetes. Enjoy!

## Folder structure

1. `app` - a Python app for which we'll create a docker image, run in Kubernetes, and see that it is instrumented with Prometheus
2. `k8s_resources` - the Kubernetes resources required to run the Python app
3. `lab` - documentation to see the metrics of the app
